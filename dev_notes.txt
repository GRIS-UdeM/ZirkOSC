issue #42, j'ai une oscillation en xy que j'avais pas en rt. this also happens with octogris, right? yes. since when?
2.2.3: yes
2.1.3: yes    
2.0.15: yes
2.0.12: yes
it basically happened all the time, and nobody noticed...?

hypotheses/tests
    * this will not happen with a pendulum going only in one direction
        * correct
   
   * the problem is only when READING the automations. 
        * so if there was a way that i could wait for pairs of xy values to be read 
          before refreshing, it could help?
        * setIsRecordingAutomation is set when we move a control. so in theory, if we 
          are not recording automation, and setParameter is called, then we are reading 
          an automation. 
        * so what we can do is block the message thing between a setX and setY
            * that doesn't do anything. refresh is almost never blocked. 

    * there's some numerical error when reading the automation. 
        * so basically xyToAzimElev is not right. i could test a bunch of azim->xy->azim 
          conversions
        * float = 6 decimal places
        * i did that, and smallest numerical error required to see oscillation is .001
          so very unlikely that this is the problem
    
    * ok. so the problem has to be when writing automations. basically, the y we write is not the one that goes with the x that we wrote. like there's a delay between storing x and storing y, which may be caused by the different daws. For instance, DP has no such oscillations.

so my understanding is that this may be due to reaper not recording initial state of plugin in the automation? Right, the first point it records is after the circle was started, so we get back to that point. yeah it's definitely something like that. Logic doesn't do that. and the reason it doesn't do that in write in reaper, is because we are still writing after the trajectory is done, so it doesn't return to its "original", initial, offset  recording point

NOT SURE WHERE ELSE TO WRITE THIS, BUT THE PROBLEM WITH REAPER AND TOUCH MODE IS THAT IT IS CONSTANTLY SETTING THE PARAMETERS IN THE PLUGIN. SO IT IS CONSTANLY CALLING SET PARAMETER. DP, FOR INSTANCE, ONLY SETS VALUES WHEN THERE IS A CHANGE.

MEETING
* logic is fine, continue as usual
* send version asap

damped pendulum cycles and oscillations interact, they need to be independent, check for fix #60 and do something similar

the problem is the nbr osc parameter, which isn't accurate

#75 and #76
I think these problems are related. why int the hell are azimuth and elevation being changed together?!
    * doesn't happen with circle trajectory. elevation is unchanged. at least as reported by the sliders
ok, changing ZirkOSC_Azim_Min and ZirkOSC_Elev_Max to .9999999 helped with this. so there are definitely some floating point issues at play here. Should I convert everything to double?
